I prefer to do smart working than hard working i.e., want to be clear on what, why and how are we going to do. Based on which need to find out any open source tools can be used to reduce our manual effort and automate things as much as possible.

I am a pretty open guy and would like to do things with full involvement. Always I want to be satisfied with my work done and should feel happy that my contribution has added value to the company.

 

In current company my work life balance is good. But some more are really missing.

The reasons for looking out from my current company are
1. I like to have a roadmap on the product from the company perspective, to know why we need to develop the product. This is completely missing. 
2. I plan my things clearly on how to execute things. Here the management is not getting the requirement details clearly and keep changing it everyday. So, could not focus on the delivery.

 

why your company?
1. The company which provide service for its own group and so definitely would have clarity on what is needed.
2. Also, I would get a feel that I am developing product for my company's group. Because when I was with PayPal I used to get a feel that it is my own product and so I will try to make it better as much as possible. Since I have good clarity, I could propose new changes and got them approved by higher management easily. I am seeing your company also in the same line of PayPal.
3. I do have some financial knowledge which I gained in PayPal. And expecting that will get an opportunity to apply those in making things better and easy to pick up things as well.
