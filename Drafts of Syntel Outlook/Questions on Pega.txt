1. How to create a new application?
2. How to create stages, cases under the created application? How to use activities, cases, stages? Based on your experience, is there anything which we need to consider while developing?
3. By default, the input values will be persisted in clipboard, right? which can be accessed using the same property name, correct?
4. On form submit, how can we validate the input values and then persist them in database.
5. I saw that Pega uses PostgreSQL database. So, all our data will get persisted in PostgreSQL? Also, how the tables get created in databases? Can we check it?
6. Suppose if we want to use some other databases(other than PostgreSQL) then what sort of configuration needs to be done?
7. How can we consume a third party API using connectors? Also how to expose as REST APIs using Services.
