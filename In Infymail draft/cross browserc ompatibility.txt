In H-D:
1.	HTML 4 and CSS 2
2.	No tables and only tiles are used to plug in the jsp components. Not sure about the usage of HTML layout with Div & SPAN
3.	JQuery is used very less and only for few javascript and not for CSS.
4.	Already QA used to test the pages in IE, Firefox and Chrome browsers, but might be in older versions

General practice
1.	Follow HTML standards and latest CSS
2.	Use proper CSS frameworks to get browser support in both latest and older versions
3.	Use JQuery for CSS to get better support in all browsers. But again JQuery is supported only in latest browser versions.
